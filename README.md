# go-batcher

This is a batcher inspired by [GraphQL's Dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) and [yckao's dataloader implementation](https://github.com/yckao/go-dataloader). 
If dataloader is batch to load somedata, why not use same way to **do something?**
That's why this project start.
